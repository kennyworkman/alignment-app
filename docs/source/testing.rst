Testing the App
===============

The application is built with several unit tests written with the `Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ pacakge.

These tests are located in the 'tests' folder in the root project directory.

To run them, simply make sure pytest is installed (see :ref:`quickstart`) and run the following command while in **root** directory::
  
  pytest 

If everything looks all good, great! If not, either reconsult the :ref:`quickstart` or back to square one with the :ref:`api`...
